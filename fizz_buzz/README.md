# FizzBuzz

Write a program that accepts a number from 1 to 100 and returns that number. But for multiples of three return 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five return 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return 'FizzBuzz'.

For invalid input, return 'I do not know what that is'.
